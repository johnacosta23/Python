# SENTENCE: A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...

# In the above example, the word far is repeated twice. However, we'd instead like to repeat it exactly N times without changing the rest of the sentence at all. There should be a comma right after each occurrence except for the last one.

# Given N , can you produce the correct sentence?

N = int(input())
if N > 1:
    print("A long time ago in a galaxy" + " far,"*(N-1)+ " far away...")
else:
    print("A long time ago in a galaxy far away...")
